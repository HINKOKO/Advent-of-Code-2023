# **Advent of code 2023**

## **What is this**

The "Advent of code" is a series of delicious algorithmic puzzles you can try to solve, on whatever language you want. <br>
Since I started a few weeks ago to learn **Rust**, I decided it to give it a go with that language, helped by my friend "Ferris the crab"

Please reach me on Linkedin if you want to discuss about the solutions I posted, I'm aware that the Rust code I wrote is certainly not the best or the most idiomatic, so I'd be glad to hear from you if you have any Rusty-suggestions ! <br>
